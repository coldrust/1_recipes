    <h1>Meatballs Recipe</h1>
    <img src="img/meatballs.jpg" alt="Meatballs Image">

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped Italian flat leaf parsley</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups stale Italian bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>>Combine beef, garlic, eggs, cheese, parsley, salt and pepper in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Blend bread crumbs into meat mixture. Slowly add the water 1/2 cup at a time. 
            The mixture should be very moist but still hold its shape if rolled into meatballs. 
            (I usually use about 1 1/4 cups of water). Shape into meatballs.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet. Fry meatballs in batches. 
            When the meatball is very brown and slightly crisp remove from the heat and drain on a paper towel. 
            (If your mixture is too wet, cover the meatballs while they are cooking so that they hold their shape better.)</li>
    </ol>
